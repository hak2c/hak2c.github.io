    <h3>How can a request a quote button benefit your store</h3>
    <p>
      Instead of providing a pricing table that include the price for each group
      of product which might not cover all product features for customers or ask
      the customer to send an email, using a <i>request a quote</i> button can
      help you more.
    </p>
    <h3>Lower abandoned cart and price leakage</h3>
    <p>
      Once the customers see that in your store, the product either can buy or
      negotiate, the customers will not rush to leave their cart right away if
      the price is not affordable, by sending a request, customers can have more
      chances to get their items with a good price while sellers are not afraid
      of letting other customers know what price that they offered.
    </p>
    <h3>Personalize conversation with customers</h3>
    <p>
      By understanding the customer's preferences and additional requests,
      sellers can create a personalized experience that matches the customers’
      needs. A request a quote button is also ideal for sellers who just want to
      promote their product online and need direct communication with customers
      such as Lawyers service, Graphic Designer…

    <h3>Drive more B2B sales</h3>
    <p>
      What can be better if a store can attract big wholesalers to buy their
      products if it matches their requirements? Providing a request a quote
      option creates an easy way for wholesalers to ask and negotiate an
      affordable price and you need a qualified salesman to discuss with them.
      If you have a salesman team, that would be easier to assign different
      quotes to different team members. Learn more how the feature in this
      plugin can

    <h3>Develop your marketing channel</h3>
    <p>
      Even if you could not close sales with customers after negotiating price,
      sellers still have the customers' information to use for their marketing
      activities. A proper way of delivery information to them increases
      potential sales.
