    <br />(BPT) - Chic, trendy, sporty, bohemian, sophisticated, fun, classic —
    you probably have a clear vision of your fashion and style personality. But
    do you know your laundry personality? How you wash the clothes you wear is
    every bit as personal and unique to you as the clothes themselves. Knowing
    your laundry personality could help ease the load and make the chore easy
    and fail-proof.

    A quarter of American households say they overload their washer most of the
    time, according to a survey commissioned by LG Electronics. Even people who
    say they are doing their laundry efficiently still have complaints with the
    process. In fact, more than three-fourths believe washers can be improved.

    Recognizing your laundry personality and choosing products that cater to
    your unique style will make doing laundry an easy, and perhaps even
    enjoyable, affair! Here are four common laundry personalities, their
    identifying traits, and tips for achieving maximum efficiency:

    Does your desire to separate and preserve clothes, including those delicate
    special care items, ever leave you with the only option of running the
    washer with just one or two items? You’re not alone. According to a recent
    survey commissioned by LG Electronics, 60 percent of Americans admitted to
    running a full load of laundry for six items or less.

    will put an end to that, letting consumers tackle two loads of laundry at
    once, or independently. The industry-first two-in-one washing machine
    includes a front-load washer ergonomically placed on the top for larger
    loads, and a smaller washer, the LG Sidekick, which sits within the pedestal
    for those small specialty loads. The LG SideKick provides an additional
    1-foot capacity and has six cycles to choose from: normal, intimates, hand
    wash, active wear, rinse + spin and tub clean, allowing consumers to wash
    those smaller loads, saving time and energy.

    Does the thought of washing dark jeans and a pink blouse in the same load
    leave you light-headed? You and 20 percent of Americans prefer to avoid
    mixing items of different colors in the same load. Some of those surveyed
    also don’t trust washing items like delicates (52 percent), jackets (49
    percent) and blouses (30 percent) in the main wash.
  </p>
</div>
<div>
  <p>
    Facilitate your separation efforts by using multiple baskets or hampers in
    your laundry room. Label them — darks, whites, delicates, workout, etc. —
    and encourage family members to drop their dirty clothes in the appropriate
    basket. For items not trusted for the main wash, the LG SideKick, part of
    the TWINWash system, can help tackle smaller loads, ensuring they’re
    properly washed by one of the six cycles.

      Do you do minimal separation? You’re joined by a majority of Americans
      that load up their washer. A recent survey concluded that 80 percent of
      Americans have purposely overloaded their washer to avoid doing a second
      load of laundry. Plus, 22 percent of Americans have deemed clothes not
      properly cleaned because of an overloaded washer. High-efficiency
      front-load washing machines alleviate both of these problems. Unlike
      traditional top-load washing machines with agitators, front-load washers
      offer greater capacity while using much less water, which actually cleans
      clothes better! It’s a myth that more water equals cleaner clothes. Plus,
      they have faster spin speeds than their top-load counterparts, which means
      your clothes come out dryer, saving you time and energy when drying your
      clothes.
    </p>

  <p>
    Use color-safe detergent and cold water for every load of colors. With
    today’s super-efficient detergents and better washing machines, you don’t
    need hot or even warm water to get clothes clean; cold will work just fine
    and will reduce the chance of colors fading or bleeding into each other.

  <p><strong>The habitual dry cleaner </strong></p>
</div>
<div>
  <p>
    Summer is a busy — and sticky — time, running from work to outdoor barbecues
    during the hottest months of the year. And refreshing that summer wardrobe
    between pool parties is key to the habitual dry cleaner looking and feeling
    their best. That’s where the LG Styler comes in. The LG Styler is a
    fashion-forward, one-of-a-kind clothing management system that can refresh
    and sanitize clothing in as little as 20 minutes. Just get back from an
    outdoor cocktail party? Simply place your favorite dresses, shirts or suits
    inside and let LG’s TrueSteam technology work its magic to reduce wrinkles
    and odors from things like sweat or smoke, without any harsh chemicals.
    While it doesn’t replace dry cleaning, it can certainly help reduce trips to
    the cleaners while keeping your clothes crisp and ready to go before your
    next brunch date or happy hour.

    Whatever your laundry personality, you can find a washer, dryer and
    detergent that will make your chore easier and less time consuming. Then,
    you can spend that time on other things. In fact, Americans surveyed say if
    they could cut their laundry time in half, they’d spend that extra time
    hanging out with their kids, watching TV or doing other things they enjoy.
